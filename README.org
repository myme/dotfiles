* Dotfiles

These are my dotfiles. There are many like them, but these ones are mine. I take
my dotfiles very seriously, as any professional programmer should.

For the time being, I'm using ~git~ to track my configurations across multiple
hosts using branches. These branches has a set of host-specific patches which
are continuously rebased on top of the master branch. This provides a sensible
backup across hosts, while having tailored configuration for each host.

Most configurations are applied by symlinking dotfiles into ~$HOME~ using [[https://www.gnu.org/software/stow/][GNU stow]].

** Install Home Manager

#+BEGIN_SRC shell
nix-channel --add https://github.com/rycee/home-manager/archive/master.tar.gz home-manager
nix-channel --update
#+END_SRC

On NixOS you may need to log out and back in for the channel to become
available. On non-NixOS you may have to add:

#+BEGIN_SRC shell
export NIX_PATH=$HOME/.nix-defexpr/channels${NIX_PATH:+:}$NIX_PATH
#+END_SRC

to your shell.

#+BEGIN_SRC shell
nix-shell '<home-manager>' -A install
#+END_SRC

If you do not plan on having Home Manager manage your shell configuration then you must source the

#+BEGIN_SRC shell
$HOME/.nix-profile/etc/profile.d/hm-session-vars.sh
#+END_SRC

file in your shell configuration. Unfortunately, in this specific case we currently only support POSIX.2-like shells such as Bash or Z shell.

For example, if you use Bash then add

#+BEGIN_SRC shell
. "$HOME/.nix-profile/etc/profile.d/hm-session-vars.sh"
#+END_SRC

** Installation

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
stow --target=$HOME <dir>
#+END_SRC

I'm mostly using a tiny bash wrapper around stow:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
$ ./install <emacs|git|zsh|...>
#+END_SRC

see:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
$ ./install -h
#+END_SRC

** Submodules

I'm using ~git submodules~ to track some external dependencies like [[https://github.com/myme/doom-emacs][Doom Emacs]],
[[https://github.com/myme/prezto][Prezto]], [[https://github.com/junegunn/fzf.git][fzf]] (NB: some are personal forks of awesome upstream software, so please
check out the origin).

** Issues :noexport:

*** DNS resolve                                                         :dns:

Ref this answer, multi-case DNS may cause issues: [[http://askubuntu.com/questions/81797/nslookup-finds-ip-but-ping-doesnt][nslookup finds ip, but ping doesnt]]

In [[file:/etc/nsswitch.conf::#%20hosts:%20files%20mdns4_minimal%20%5BNOTFOUND=return%5D%20resolve%20%5B!UNAVAIL=return%5D%20dns][nsswitch.conf]], change the following:

#+BEGIN_SRC diff
- hosts:          files mdns4_minimal [NOTFOUND=return] resolve [!UNAVAIL=return] dns
+ hosts:          files dns
#+END_SRC

or remove completely:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
$ sudo apt remove libnss-mdns
#+END_SRC

*** ZSH 5.2 has a broken function in `VCS_INFO_nvcsformats`             :zsh:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh

Comment out the line as mentioned in the script above to get paths in the prompt working.
